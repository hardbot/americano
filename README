Project 2A Submission

Used a simple while loop that took input line by line and parsed the string into key and value tuples to be placed in a RecordFile.


Project 2B Submission

Implemented BTLeafNode such that the number of elements in the node is listed in the first four bytes of the buffer. The following four bytes is a pointer to the next leaf node. All bytes after that are structs of elements with rid and key.

Implemented BTNonLeafNode such that the number of elements in the node is listed in the first four bytes and the following four bytes is a pointer to the rightmost child.

In locate and locateChildPtr, we used binary search instead of a linear search to be more efficient.

Project 2C Submission
Implemented BTIndexTree 

Reimplemented BTNonLeafNode to store the left most child pointer within the first 8 bytes isntead of the right most child pointer.  Due to this we needed to reimplement locate and insertandsplit functions.
